   <pre>Certainly, here is the 2-Year Weekly Plan To Learn DSA and Development without the table format:

    **2-Year Weekly Plan To Learn DSA and Development**
    
    *This roadmap provides a structured, week-by-week plan for learning DSA fundamentals, exploring development areas, mastering specialization, building projects, and preparing for hackathons and internships.*
   
<ul>**Year 1**

    <li>
      <li>
        * **Months 1-3: DSA Basics (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)**
    * Weeks 1-2: Learn array operations, string manipulation. (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode)
    * Weeks 3-4: Study single, doubly, circular linked lists. (HackerRank, YouTube)
    * Weeks 5-6: Implement and solve problems on stacks and queues. (CodeChef, freeCodeCamp)
    * Weeks 7-8: Review topics, solve additional problems, and revise key concepts. (Practice on LeetCode, HackerRank)
    * Weeks 9-10: Participate in mock contests to improve problem-solving speed. (Codeforces, AtCoder)

      </li>  
<li>
    * **Months 4-5: Intermediate DSA (Recursion, Trees, Hashing)**
    * Weeks 11-12: Learn basic to advanced recursion, backtracking. (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode)
    * Weeks 13-14: Study binary trees, BST, tree traversals. (YouTube - freeCodeCamp, HackerRank)
    * Weeks 15-16: Master hashing and its applications in problems. (Codeforces, CodeChef)
    * Weeks 17-18: Solve problems combining recursion, trees, and hashing concepts. (LeetCode, AtCoder)

</li>
<li>
    * **Months 6-8: Advanced DSA (Heaps, Graphs, Dynamic Programming)**
    * Weeks 19-20: Understand heaps, priority queues, and their applications. (YouTube - Abdul Bari, GeeksforGeeks)
    * Weeks 21-24: Study graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest paths, topological sort. (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode)
    * Weeks 25-28: Solve fundamental DP problems, focus on understanding state relations. (LeetCode, CodeChef, HackerRank)

</li>

<li>
    * **Months 9-10: DSA Revision & Mock Contests**
    * Weeks 29-34: Weekly review of DSA concepts and practice. (LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder)
    * Weeks 35-36: Participate in mock contests, focusing on time complexity and optimization. (Codeforces, AtCoder)

</li>
<li>
    * **Months 11-12: Intro to Development (Explore Frontend, Backend, Mobile, ML)**
    * Weeks 37-40: Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics. (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy)
    * Weeks 41-42: Introduction to Node.js or Flask for backend basics. (YouTube, freeCodeCamp)
    * Weeks 43-44: Try out React Native or Flutter for mobile development basics. (YouTube, Udemy)
    * Weeks 45-46: Introduction to ML with Python basics (NumPy, Pandas). (Coursera, YouTube)
    * Weeks 47-48: Build a simple project combining DSA knowledge and a development area of interest. (GitHub)

</li>

    </li>
</ul>
**Year 2**

* **Months 13-15: Development Specialization (Pick One: Web, Mobile, ML)**
    * Weeks 49-52: Study in-depth skills in your chosen specialization. (Udemy, Coursera)
    * Weeks 53-55: Master frameworks and tools related to your specialization. (YouTube, official documentation)
    * Weeks 56-60: Build a more complex project using these skills (e.g., a full-stack app or ML model). (GitHub, Stack Overflow)



* **Months 16-17: Advanced DSA (Competitive Coding)**
    * Weeks 61-64: Solve timed problems weekly to develop speed and strategy. (Codeforces, AtCoder)
    * Weeks 65-68: Focus on time-space complexity, code efficiency, and memory optimization. (TopCoder, CodeChef)



* **Months 18-20: Specialized Project Building**
    * Weeks 69-76: Build 2-3 advanced projects aligned with your specialization, like e-commerce or ML model. (GitHub, GitLab)



* **Months 21-22: Portfolio & Resume Building**
    * Weeks 77-78: Create a personal website or GitHub portfolio to showcase projects. (GitHub Pages, Medium)
    * Weeks 79-82: Start networking, updating your resume, and reaching out to mentors on LinkedIn. (LinkedIn, Medium)



* **Months 23-24: Hackathon Prep & Internship Applications**
    * Weeks 83-88: Form teams and practice hackathon-like challenges; focus on rapid prototyping. (Devpost, MLH)
    * Weeks 89-92: Apply for internships, practice technical interviews, review DSA and project experience. (LinkedIn, Glassdoor)



**Additional Tips & Resources**

* Platforms for DSA: LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, HackerRank.
* Development Tutorials: Use YouTube, Udemy, and freeCodeCamp based on your area of interest.
* Networking: Connect on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn.
* Hackathons: Regularly check Devpost and MLH for opportunities.



**Goal Milestones**

* 6 Months: Solid foundation in DSA basics.
* 1 Year: Mini project and understanding of development fields.
* 1.5 Years: Development specialization and advanced DSA.
* 2 Years: Comprehensive portfolio, internship readiness, and hackathon experience.



**Good luck with this journey! Stay consistent, enjoy each milestone, and strive to make every project a memorable learning experience. ðŸŽ‰**
